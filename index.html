<!-- Perfect Date -->
<h3>The Perfect Date</h3>
<p>Teddy's idea of a perfect date
would be going to the park for a
rousing game of chase. After,
Teddy and his date would share
a lovely three course meal. Finally,
they would cuddle in a loving food
coma.</p>-

<!-- Deal Breakers -->
<h3>Deal Breakers!</h3>
<p>Teddy hates bad attitudes! His ideal
date must love sharing and be
affectionate! His date cannot be too
tall, or else he will play dead the
whole date! Since Teddy is only two
years old, his ideal date must
be able to keep up with his energy,
so five years and under!</p>
